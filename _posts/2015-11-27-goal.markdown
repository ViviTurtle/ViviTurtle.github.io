[![Start]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/Start.png)]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/Start.png)

Another baby CTF question. It was very simple, even though it did throw me off quite a bit... We are given a link: [http://129.21.39.225:82/](http://129.21.39.225:82/). When visiting the site all it had was a gif of some guys playing soccer 

[![goal]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/goal.gif)]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/goal.gif)

Maybe we should look at the [source]({{site.url}}/assets/rc3/Goal/source.html)?

```html
<html>
<title>GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!1</title>

<img src="goal.gif" alt="goal"/>

</html>
```

No helpful data in there. I tried doing a quick directory search such as /flag, /.git, and /admin and none of those worked. I also tried looking at the metadeta

>exiftool goal.gif

Nothing showed up there either. Luckily I always keep **Burp Suite** and **Zap Proxy** up. Let's look at the [request]({{site.url}}/assets/rc3/Goal/request). I opened my Burp, searched for the ip address, searched for the page, and looked at the [request]({{site.url}}/assets/rc3/Goal/request).

[![Request]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/Request.png)]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/Request.png)

```
GET http://129.21.39.225:82/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 129.21.39.225:82

Everything looks normal there. Now let's look at the [response]({{site.url}}/assets/rc3/Goal/response) from the web server.

[![Response]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/Response.png)]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/Goal/Response.png)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 21 Nov 2015 20:07:23 GMT
Server: Apache
Flag: RC3-SOCCER-8675309
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 95
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

<html>

<img src="goal.gif" alt="goal"/>

</html>
```

We see something very interesting here. There's a section called "Flag" with the value: RC3-SOCCER-8675309.  Finally we have the flag: **RC3-SOCCER-8675309**
