Most of it is thanks to Google, the programmer and a hacker's most useful tool. Whether it's looking up how to configure your first web server or learning what a "Segmentation fault" is; Google has always been the techy's best friend. As a result, Google will sometimes lead you to a couple of technical blogs. From a programmer and Information Security aspect, I would like to share with you some of the few blogs I follow.<br /><br />The first is <a href="http://openmymind.net/">Karl Seguin</a>. He is a jack of many trades and his blog posts consists of poetry, to programming, to information security. Not only are they informal, but they do provide some interesting insight and opinions. It differs well from other blogs, because it's not a tutorial blog or a recent news blog. It's a blog about his inner thoughts and experiences in the technical world. If you're looking for someone interesting to follow, while not being bored by formal writing, Karl Seguin is the man to go to.<br /><br />The second I would like to show you is <a href="http://colesec.inventedtheinternet.com/">ColeSec Security</a>. His blogs consists of very basic cyber-security tutorials. There is no doubt to in my mind, that his blog is one of the very few blogs that translate complicated information security terms, into something noobies can comprehend. It is one of the first blogs I followed and it helped me get started in the field. If you're new to the InfoSec field, I would definitely recommend looking at a few of his blogs.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ffUx-S-tbI4/Uzp8FW2o2dI/AAAAAAAABjA/YuyCTd20T6M/s1600/ie8.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ffUx-S-tbI4/Uzp8FW2o2dI/AAAAAAAABjA/YuyCTd20T6M/s1600/ie8.png" height="241" width="320" /></a>The last is <a href="http://blog.commandlinekungfu.com/">Command Line Kung Fu</a>. This blog consist of different people whom are masters in their own operating system whether its Windows or Linux. The blog, although hard to follow for new people, give some of the best shortcuts one can use in the field. I was actually was able to learn directly from Hal Pomeranz and he was able to do some very interesting Computer Forensics challenges quite quickly with just the command line. For example, some commands include a bash script that converts a Windows document to a Linux document or even more complicated commands like creating a script that monitors the network. The blog proves that all the programs you need, can be accomplished with just a few lines of code, if done right.<br /><br />Because of the lack of resources in the Information Security Field, I hope that the increase of popularity in technical blogs fill in the empty shelves of our technical library. Throughout the course of time, technical blogs will have the ability to be a great influence to technology and our engineers. Eventually, the next generation will be able to lead the Information Security and Software Engineering fields with the help of the library many of us created.<br /><br /><div id="export-html"><div class="mla7"><div class="hang">"Google." <i>Google</i>.
