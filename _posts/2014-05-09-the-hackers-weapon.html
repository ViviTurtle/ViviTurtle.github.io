Batman has his bat tools; Superman has super-human strength, and Thor has the Mjolnir, a hammer forged in Asgard by the command of Odin. The hacker, the underground hero with the power to manipulate any of the world's technology to his/her will, also has his/her own set of tools. Whether they're reverse engineering, compromising servers, or simply sniffing networks, the hacker has a different tool for each.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N7zfN3qGgBc/U23DMzmG3VI/AAAAAAAABkw/DERZmF_7Vdw/s1600/IdaPro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N7zfN3qGgBc/U23DMzmG3VI/AAAAAAAABkw/DERZmF_7Vdw/s1600/IdaPro.jpg" height="111" width="200" /></a>If the hacker wanted to reverse engineer a program to create exploits, it would not be uncommon&nbsp; for him/her to use IdaPro. According to their website, IdaPro is an "i<span class="textunderline">nteractive</span>,           <span class="textunderline"><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/idc.shtml">programmable</a></span>,           <span class="textunderline">extendible</span>,           <span class="textunderline"><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/processors.shtml">multi-processor</a></span>          disassembler           hosted on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X." IdaPro has become one of the most standard programs in the Information Security world. Not only that, there are many add-ons the hacker can add to simplify what used to take weeks to do in a few seconds.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zPAL5vy27J0/U23DLozM2vI/AAAAAAAABko/KBcAUKyDX7E/s1600/metasploit_logo-300x73.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zPAL5vy27J0/U23DLozM2vI/AAAAAAAABko/KBcAUKyDX7E/s1600/metasploit_logo-300x73.png" height="48" width="200" /></a>One of the most important tools every hacker will use is Metasploit. According to Metasploit, Metasploit is the "World's most used penetrating testing software." This is not an understatement. Metasploit is a collection of existing exploits used against vulnerabilities in a server. You can say this is the hacker's utility belt that carries all his/her tools for combat. The hacker can also create any other exploit he wants and add it to his collection. When penetration testing, one of the first things a hacker will do is pull out this software.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-78T7bdAJHMc/U23DOO7WXmI/AAAAAAAABk4/eIAPF9uqzcA/s1600/6a00e008d95770883400e54f354d4b8834-800wi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-78T7bdAJHMc/U23DOO7WXmI/AAAAAAAABk4/eIAPF9uqzcA/s1600/6a00e008d95770883400e54f354d4b8834-800wi.jpg" height="67" width="200" /></a>Lastly, if the hacker wanted to sniff through network packets, it would be fairly common to see him/her using Wireshark.<i>&nbsp; </i>According to their website, "<span class="st"><i>Wireshark</i> is a network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows." Wireshark is one of the world's most used tools because if its simplicity, flexibility, and community. It is a GUI based network sniffer and is fairly simple to use.</span><br /><br /><span class="st">Now that you know some of the tools of the hacker, you too can join the war in the Information Security world. Will you also become a superhero? Maybe even a super villain? Train your combat skills and prepare yourself for the worst. See you in the battlefield. </span><br /><span class="st"><br /></span><br /><div id="export-html"><div class="mla7"><div class="hang">"Download." <i>Wireshark Â· Go Deep.</i> N.p., n.d.
