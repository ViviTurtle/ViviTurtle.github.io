Calvin has been doing a lot networking for the club. As such we have many companies interested in our vision of putting San Jose State as the InfoSec University of the Silicon Valley. Within the next semester, we are hoping establish a sponsorship from these companies fund and teach our club. We are about to reach new heights. Instead of following the path of self-learning and CTF's to improve our skills, we going to be taught directly from organizations with their own security protocols. Its a win-win for both of us because we receive training, sponsorships, and funding and the organizations have the best of the best graduates coming to work for them after graduation.<br /><br />Until this happens, the club will be particularly busy. We have meetings every Thursday and we spend those meetings teaching each other new Information Security concepts. I have been working and teaching on web application exploits. I HIGHLY recommend people sign up to teach a concept in the class because it forces you to actively learn new skills throughout the year. Not only that, but you get real world experience making modules to put on your resume. Once organizations start coming in, what better way is there to show off you skills than show them the modules and concepts you have personally taught? This year we mainly went through web application exploits and Reverse Engineering. This coming year were hopefully going to go into more advanced concepts of exploitation.<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dRlCAFbewLM/VJaz5NfYLQI/AAAAAAAABmQ/XV5YRMEBEMs/s1600/ruCTFE.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dRlCAFbewLM/VJaz5NfYLQI/AAAAAAAABmQ/XV5YRMEBEMs/s1600/ruCTFE.png" /></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A3XFG061f3Q/VJawoBfonQI/AAAAAAAABmE/E011mEqC0wM/s1600/150x150x3e3c03228d6e1cded08d1331e1d29558.png.pagespeed.ic.wNRxEEuBON.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A3XFG061f3Q/VJawoBfonQI/AAAAAAAABmE/E011mEqC0wM/s1600/150x150x3e3c03228d6e1cded08d1331e1d29558.png.pagespeed.ic.wNRxEEuBON.png" /></a>The club has been actively participating in many Capture the Flag Competitions. Are most recent one was 9447 CTF where the team placed 186/988. Not bad for a new team if I say so myself. This competition was an advanced Jeopardy style CTF where we got all our points in Reverse Engineering. Next up is the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. Although it is not our expertise we are always excited to be a part of such a prestige competition. Down the line after the club has established with seniors and juniors, it would then only be a matter of time until we reach the top for each competition. I have high hopes for this club and we are about to take the InfoSec world by storm. We will be posting more this coming semester as I kick all the officers off their lazy bums.
