Some are lucky and are taught to use Linux by their parents. Others have the opportunity to be coached in middle school, high school, and college levels for competitions such as Cyber Patriots and the National Cyber-Collegiate Competitions. Sadly, most people are taught after college graduation; when they get a job in system administration.&nbsp; Because of our lack of attention to the Cyber-Security realm many of our networks, systems, and applications are insecure. As such, we should be targeting this field at earlier levels such as elementary school. If you're reading this you are probably already an expert in the field or barely starting. If you're in the latter there are a few things tips that will guide you in the field.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-29_5U9Kpl4o/Ux7PFJFKJhI/AAAAAAAABiU/cjGtBJ6THQk/s1600/InfoSec+Banner.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-29_5U9Kpl4o/Ux7PFJFKJhI/AAAAAAAABiU/cjGtBJ6THQk/s1600/InfoSec+Banner.jpg" height="133" width="200" /></a></div>First, is to join a society or club. The field itself has one of the largest learning curves than any other field. Joining a club or society will give you a resource to translate complicated concepts to simpler terms. To name a few clubs: San Jose State University's Information Security Club, Cal-Poly's SWIFT, and Carnegie Mellon University's Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP).<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WtKjlWsl3IM/Ux7Po6C3NmI/AAAAAAAABik/sq47ah-ZL2s/s1600/Defcon-logo.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WtKjlWsl3IM/Ux7Po6C3NmI/AAAAAAAABik/sq47ah-ZL2s/s1600/Defcon-logo.jpg" height="150" width="200" /></a>Second, is to attend professional conferences. There are many professional meetings for cyber-security. These give you a gateway to the field and one of the best networks you can have. Like any other field, these meetings have some of the most well-known innovators in the field, as well as some of the the best events. Some meetings are cheap like Defcon and B-Sides and some are expensive like Blackhat and the RSA conferences.<br /><br />Third, is to choose your path. The field is very vast and complicated. Some of the branches are, Exploit Mitigation, Reverse Engineering, Penetration Testing, and Computer Forensics. Within these branches are many smaller branches that one can specialize in. <br /><br />Lastly, of course is to continue studying on your own. Information security is a very dynamic field. Things are always changing. Using your networks and Google-Fu skills, you can find many resources online to learn the field. Most of it is very hard to find, but it they exists. Some examples are SecurityTube.net, Hackthissite.org, and YouTube's Hak5. <br /><br />Be prepared to struggle in the field. It's a long and hard path, but the skill set you learn in this field is irreplaceable and always wanted. For every engineer, you need a security expert to match it. We have many engineers in school and in the field, yet we have barely any cyber-security experts.<br /><br />"DEF CON Hacking Conference." <i>DEF CONÂ® Hacking Conference</i>. N.p., n.d.
