This a baby CTF question. It was very simple. We are given a link: [http://129.21.39.225:81/](http://129.21.39.225:81/). Upon visiting the site we are greeted with a simple text

> nothing to see here..

Now look at the title of the web page.

[![bots]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/bots.png)]({{site.url}}/images/rc3/bots.png)

It says Go away bots! This means they don't want a web crawler to be at this website. If you guys know basic web, the way you keep web crawlers from visiting certain web pages is to write it in the **robots.txt** file.

Let's visit [http://129.21.39.225:81/robots.txt](http://129.21.39.225:81/robots.txt)

[robots.txt]({{site.url}}/assets/rc3/robots.txt)

```
#Now those silly bots can't crawl my site :3

User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /secret/
```


This means they don't want the web page to visit /admin or /secret.

Let's visit [http://129.21.39.225:81/secret](http://129.21.39.225:81/secret) too

Now we have the flag:
